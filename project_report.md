- **HTTPS**: Encrypted transmission protocol ensuring application security
- **Responsive Design**: Layout technology that adapts to different device screens

The main advantages of PWA include:
- Installation without an app store
- Support for offline operation
- Fast loading and response
- Push notification capabilities
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 2. Project Introduction

### Project Goals and Core Features

China Travel is a China tourism destination exploration application developed with Next.js, designed to provide users with information and booking services for tourist attractions across China. Core features include:

- Browsing famous tourist attractions across China
- Viewing detailed information and images of attractions
- User account management and travel booking
- Offline access to basic content
- Providing native app-like user experience

### Technology Stack Justification

#### PWA as Core Technology

This project chose PWA as its core technology feature based on the following considerations:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Through PWA technology, users can add the application to their home screen and enjoy a native app-like experience without downloading from an app store.

2. **Offline Functionality Requirement**: In travel application scenarios, users may use the app in environments with unstable networks. PWA's offline capability ensures users can still access basic content without an internet connection.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: PWA can run in any modern browser, without platform limitations, allowing the application to reach a broader user base.

#### Choice of Next.js Framework

While the course module does not specifically cover Next.js, this framework was selected for the following pragmatic reasons:

1. **PWA Implementation Simplicity**: Next.js offers streamlined PWA integration through the next-pwa plugin, significantly reducing the complexity of Service Worker configuration and management.

2. **Performance Optimization**: The framework's built-in image optimization, code splitting, and server-side rendering capabilities directly enhance PWA performance metrics, particularly on mobile devices.

3. **Development Efficiency**: Next.js's file-based routing system and integrated API routes enabled faster development of the application's core features, allowing more focus on implementing the required PWA and device API functionality.

4. **Production Readiness**: The framework provides production-optimized builds with minimal configuration, ensuring the application can be easily deployed and maintained.

It's important to note that while Next.js was used as the development framework, the core educational focus remains on implementing and understanding PWA technology and device API integration, which are framework-agnostic concepts.

### Positive Impact of the Technology

PWA technology has had the following positive impacts on the project:

- **Improved User Retention**: Through home screen icons and offline functionality, users are more likely to revisit the application
- **Performance Optimization**: Service Worker caching strategies significantly improve page loading speed and responsiveness
- **Reduced Development Costs**: Compared to native app development, PWA reduces platform-specific adaptation work
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Provides an immersive experience similar to native applications

## 3. System Architecture and Functional Module Analysis

### Overall System Architecture

China Travel is built using a modern frontend technology stack, with the architecture based on the PWA (Progressive Web App) principles. The system follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data persistence layers.

  </div>
</div>

The project implements the **Atomic Design** methodology for its component structure. This is a systematic methodology that breaks down interfaces into fundamental building blocks and then combines them to form more complex components:

- **Atoms**: The smallest building blocks of the interface (buttons, inputs, icons, etc.)
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms functioning together as a unit (form controls, cards, etc.)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and atoms (navigation bars, content sections, etc.)

This approach facilitates component reusability, maintains consistency across the application, and improves development efficiency. The component organization directly reflects this hierarchy in the project folder structure.

### Functional Module Description

The project's main functional modules include:

#### 1. Home Module
- Displays recommended/popular travel destinations
- Provides navigation to other main pages
- Implements responsive layout for different devices

#### 2. Attraction Detail Module
- Displays detailed descriptions, images, and prices of attractions
- Integrates maps to show attraction locations with geolocation data
- Provides booking functionality entry points

#### 3. Account Management Module
- User personal information management
- Booking history viewing
- Payment method management
- Camera API integration for user avatar photos

#### 4. PWA Core Module
- Service Worker configuration
- Web App Manifest settings
- Offline page and error handling
- Device API integration

### Hardware/Device API Integration

The application utilizes several device APIs to enhance the user experience:

#### 1. Geolocation API
The attraction detail pages leverage the browser's Geolocation API to:
- Display the current location of the user in relation to attractions
- Calculate distances between the user and points of interest
- Provide directions from the user's current location to attractions

```javascript
// Example of Geolocation API usage
const getUserLocation = () => {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (position) => {
        const userCoordinates = {
          latitude: position.coords.latitude,
          longitude: position.coords.longitude
        };
        setUserLocation(userCoordinates);
      },
      (error) => {
        console.error('Error getting user location:', error);
      }
    );
  }
};
```

#### 2. Camera API
The application integrates with the device camera through the MediaDevices API:
- Users can take profile pictures directly within the app
- The camera interface is built into the account management page
- Images can be captured and stored as user avatars

```javascript
// Camera API integration example
const startCamera = async () => {
  try {
    const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true });
    if (videoRef.current) {
      videoRef.current.srcObject = stream;
      setCameraActive(true);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to access camera:', error);
    alert('Cannot access camera, please check permission settings');
  }
};
```

#### 3. Device Storage API
The application uses IndexedDB and localStorage APIs for:
- Storing user data for offline access
- Caching attraction information and images
- Persisting user preferences and settings

These hardware/device API integrations are essential components of the PWA functionality, enabling rich, native-like experiences while running in a browser environment.

### Technical Implementation Details

#### PWA Configuration Implementation

The core configuration of PWA is implemented through the `next-pwa` package in `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const withPWA = require('next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public',
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
})

const nextConfig = {}

module.exports = withPWA(nextConfig)
```

#### Offline Page Implementation

The offline page is an important component of PWA, providing a friendly prompt when users lose network connection:

```typescript
export default function OfflinePage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center p-4 text-center">
      <div className="mb-8">
        <Logo isDisplayMobile />
      </div>
      <h1 className="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold">You are currently offline</h1>
      <p className="mb-8 max-w-md text-gray-600">
        It looks like your network connection is interrupted. Please check your network connection and try again.
        Some features may still be available in offline mode.
      </p>
      <Button asChild>
        <Link href="/" className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <ArrowLeft size={18} />
          Back to Home
        </Link>
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Service Worker Caching Strategy

The Service Worker automatically generated by `next-pwa` implements the following caching strategies:

1. **Precaching Core Resources**: Core JS, CSS, and HTML files are cached in advance during the installation phase
2. **Image Resource Caching**: Uses Network First strategy, prioritizing retrieving the latest images from the network
3. **API Request Caching**: Uses Stale-While-Revalidate strategy, returning cached content first and then updating in the background
4. **Offline Page Fallback**: Automatically navigates to the offline page during network failures

#### Data Persistence and Offline Access

Using IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) to implement data persistence, supporting offline data access:

```typescript
// Database definition
class ChinaTravelDB extends Dexie {
  items!: Dexie.Table<VacationItemTypes, string>;
  bookings!: Dexie.Table<BookingDataTypes, string>;
  members!: Dexie.Table<MemberTypes, string>;
  payments!: Dexie.Table<PaymentTypes, string>;

  constructor() {
    super("ChinaTravelDB");

    this.version(1).stores({
      items: "id, title, city, country, unit, price, rating, description, image, sum_booking",
      bookings: "id, invoice, amount, total, item_id, member_id, payment_id",
      members: "id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number",
      payments: "id, created_at, card_number, card_holder_name, cvc"
    });
  }
}
```
